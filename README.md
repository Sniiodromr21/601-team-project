## Product Mission
Our mission is to utilize graph databases and graph neural networks (GNN) to develop an easy-to-use diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease. By integrating the medical data obtainable, we aim to offer healthcare professionals deeper insights into disease progression, early diagnosis, and personalized treatment strategies. Our objective is to enhance patient outcomes and support the global battle against Alzheimer's disease through advanced technology.

## User Stories
As a family member of a potential Alzheimer’s patient, I want an easy-to-use application that allows me to perform an initial assessment at home using cognitive tests and symptom checklists, so that I can detect early signs of Alzheimer’s and seek professional medical advice if necessary.
As a research organization, I want to use the tool for clinical trial recruitment by identifying patients who match specific genetic or cognitive profiles related to Alzheimer’s.
As a data scientist, I want to explore large-scale Alzheimer’s datasets using graph neural networks, allowing me to discover new relationships and predictors of Alzheimer’s progression.
As a neurologist, I want a system that can quickly integrate various patient data, including MRI scans, genetic tests, and cognitive assessments, so that I can make more informed diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease.

## MVP(Minumum Viable Product)
Graph Database Integration: Implement a graph database to store and manage patient data such as MRI images, genetic information, and cognitive tests. The database will model relationships between biomarkers, clinical features, and disease progression.

Graph Neural Network Model: Build a GNN model that can process the graph-based medical data and predict Alzheimer's diagnosis based on predefined criteria like biomarker levels, cognitive scores, and genetic risk factors.

Data Visualization: Develop a basic user interface to allow healthcare professionals to input patient data and visualize the relationship between biomarkers, genetic risk, and clinical outcomes in an interactive graph format.

Predictive Insights: Provide early predictive insights based on existing patient data to indicate the likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease and the progression stage, displayed in a user-friendly dashboard.
